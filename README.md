# mac-os-bootstrap
Bootstrapping for fun and profit

I need to learn Ansible and could do to get a bit better and general bash scripting... So with a little help from my friends, well, mostly ripping them off, this repo is provided for anyone who wants to bootstrap a Mac and have it be as non-interactive as possible.

## Steps:
- Clone this repo
- run `xcode-select --install`
- run `bootstrap.sh`
- Let `ansible` install everything for you!
