Bootstrapping for fun and profit

I need to learn Ansible and could do to get a bit better and general bash scripting... So with a little help from my friends, well, mostly ripping them off, this repo is provided for anyone who wants to bootstrap a Mac and have it be as non-interactive as possible.
